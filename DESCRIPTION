Description: 'Smart Adaptive Recommendations' (SAR) is the name of a fast, scalable, adaptive algorithm for personalized recommendations based on user transactions and item descriptions. It produces easily explainable/interpretable recommendations and handles "cold item" and "semi-cold user" scenarios. This package provides two implementations of 'SAR': a standalone implementation, and an interface to a web service in Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud: <https://github.com/Microsoft/Product-Recommendations/blob/master/doc/sar.md>. The former allows fast and easy experimentation, and the latter provides robust scalability and extra features for production use.
